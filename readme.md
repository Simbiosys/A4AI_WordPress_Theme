////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//												View compilation (for public views)
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Views must be compiled before being used.
To compile a view execute the following in a terminal:

php starter.php

To run a process to auto-compile views, set the path in 'views' folder:

cd /renderization/views

And then execute:

watch -d 'php <path_to_starter.php'>

i.e.: watch -d 'php /Volumes/proyectos/a4ai/web/wordpress/wp-content/themes/A4AI/renderization/starter.php'

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//									 									Clear caches
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

There is SH file called 'restart.sh' in the root of the theme. We could invoke it to clear
all the caches, it also invokes the previous starter.php file.

./restart.sh

As before, we could call it in the watch command:

watch -d ./<path_to_restart.sh>

i.e.: watch -d /Volumes/proyectos/a4ai/web/wordpress/wp-content/themes/A4AI/restart.sh

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//								  						Clear WPEngine Cache
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The A4AI project is hosted by WPEngine. This service has a enabled cache that should be
cleared after any update to view the changes.

In the Wordpress Dashboard we have a link at the top of the left sidebar called 'WP Engine',
there we should click on the button 'Purge All Caches'. This should be done in the
production server after any update.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//															Renderization folder
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- compiled-views Any template used by this engine must be compiled before use. After any
	change it should be compiled to view the changes. To compile them use starter.php as
	described above.
- compiler.php This class is used to compile views. It contains the array of helpers, so
	if a new helper is needed it should be added here.
- controller.php This class manages the view that should be rendered and the model that
	should be executed to obtain the JSON data.
- dashboard/ This folder contains the files needed to render the private report management
	in the dashboard. Out of this folder you will find the files to render user public
	views.
- data/ Contains cached data to avoid calling the external Data API.
	- api.php This resource is called from JS to gets data from the external API, the first
		time a URL is asked for it calls the external API and stores the result in a file,
		any later call will get the stored file data.
- models/ Here you will find the models that return the data shown in the view. The name
	of each file will match the name of the view with PHP as extension. report.hbs will
	ask models/report.php for data.
- utils/ auxiliary methods.
- views/ Template views. Any change should be followed by a call of the starter.php file.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//															Public resource flow
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- A user visits the /report resource. This resource is supported by this render engine.
- renderer.php looks for a template called report. It uses compiled views so it search for
	the file renderization/compiled-views/report.php. This is the reason why you have to
	compile any changed view.
- Now, renderer.php will look for a model to obtain the data. If exists it will be called
	renderization/models/report.php.
- The compiled view is executed, it used the model-returned data to replace the handlebars
	tags. The returned value is the HTML that is send to the browser.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//								   				Private Report Management
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- functions.php defines two custom report types:
	- report: a report represents a year A4AI report.
	- report_item: each report part of one report, it could be a chapter, part of a chapter,
		a table, a chart, etc.

	These report types are used to manage the report in the private dashboard and to
	generate the report that the user views in the public report section.

	In functions.php some Wordpress handlers are defined for the report management.

- renderization/dashboard/compiled-views These folder contains the compiled views used in
	the private area, dashboard.
- renderization/dashboard/css These CSS files are used in the private area for the report
	management.
- renderization/dashboard/data Contains cached data.
	- charts.json Defines the catalogue of charts that appears in any report item edition.
	- tables.json This file contains the catalogue of tables of the report. Tables are
		generated in renderization/utils/report_utils.php and are cached in this file. Any
		change in the generation of the tables should be followed by a removal of this file.
		DO NOT delete charts.json.
- js/ JavaScript files used in the report management.
- views/ The views used in the dashboard. Any change should be followed by a removal of
	the compiled view.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//														Report Data Tables
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

To create a new data table for the report you will need to create TXT file with the HTML of
the table in the directory /renderization/models/tables. You could follow the syntax of
any of the existing ones to create a new table. Notice that the caption of the table
includes the tag {{caption}} that is replaced in the PHP code.

The <table> tag must have a unique id. Once the table is created you should include it in
the function generateDataTables of the file /renderization/utils/report_utils.php.

That function returns an object that includes the catalogue of tables for each year. The
identifier of the table in that object must match the id you set in the <table> tag.

After creating a table you need to delete the cached file:

renderization/dashboard/data/tables.json

That file is removed by the SH restart.sh, so you could invoke it to create the new
catalogue of tables.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//															Cached resources
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/renderizarion/data/api/*.json
	These files are the cached resources that the
	data explorer requests in AJAX calls. These are cached by the api.php file that
	is the one the explorer calls. Only the first visit of each indicator calls the
	data.a4ai.org API, the following calls return the cached resources.

/renderization/data/data/initial.json
	This file contains the static values the
	data explorer needs. This includes the list of years, the list of countries,
	the list of indicators and the values for the INDEX and the two subindices
	ACCESS and INFRASTRUCTURE.

/renderization/dashboard/data/tables.json
	This JSON file stores the generated tables the report shows. We need to delete
	this file each time we modify or create a table.

Remember that these cached files are removed by the restart.sh script and once
they are needed, they are created if the model does not find them.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//															Data Explorer
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The data explorer view, data, is compound of these other partial views:   

- /renderization/views/partials/data-map Renders the world map.
- /renderization/views/partials/data-list Renders the table under the map.
- /renderization/views/partials/data-country-search It's the country search control at the top right corner.
- /renderization/views/partials/data-country It's the country detail box. It includes the comparison section.


This view includes the following JS scripts:

- /scripts/data/functions.js Auxiliary functions for the data explorer.
- /scripts/data/list.js To render the table under the map.
- /scripts/data/map.js To render the map, control the main user actions and page status.
- /scripts/data/search.js To control the country search.

At the bottom of the data.hbs template you will find that the initial data is
loaded there and the function loadInitialData is invoked to start the page
rendering.

That function will perform some initial actions and will invoke the function
setPageStateful that defines the stateful behaviour of the page. If defines what
to do at the beginning, what to do after any URL change and it also defines the
parameters that define the page status:

- _year The selected year. Latest one if no one is selected.
- indicator The selected indicator. INDEX if no other one is selected.
- country The selected country. If a country is selected the country detail is shown.
- compare The country the previous country is compared to. If there is a comparing country the comparison section of the country detail is shown.

Any time the URL changes we need to update the social network link to keep to be consistent and share the same resource you are viewing.

renderCharts is the function used to render the charts after the change of any
of the parameters. The script stores the information in memory so if the user asks
for any URL twice the second and following times the memory version is used. It
is not stored in local storage, so if you refresh the page is memory is cleaned.

JSONP is used to get the data, and the function getObservationsCallback is the
callback of the request.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//															Visualisations
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

2014 Version included two visualisations, visualisation1 and visualisation2.

There are views, JavaScript files and models for them. And they are also cached
in /renderization/data/data as visualisation1.json and visualisation2.json
